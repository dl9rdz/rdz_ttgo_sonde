Important behaviour of WiFiClient:

If anything goes wrong in a read or write operation on a WiFiClient, it internally
will call WiFiClient.stop(), which sets _rxBuffer to NULL and connected to false. 

Subsequently, any function call to WiFiClient that uses _rxBuffer will cause an

error and subsequent reboot.

available() is safe to call (it checks that rxBuffer is not null)
write() is safe to call (it checks that connected is true)
but read() and peek() are not. 

This has been fixed in newer versions of the esp library, see

So there is at least one reason to eventually upgrade to 2.0.0. Currently we stick to 1.0.6.
